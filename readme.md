# Form Validation

This is a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates form validation and processing user input. It includes functionality to validate form fields and check if passwords match before submitting the form.

## Code Explanation

- The code uses the Constraint API and JavaScript to validate the form and check for password matching.
- The form element and input elements (password1, password2) are accessed using their respective `id` attributes.
- The code sets up event listeners to trigger form validation and data submission on form submission.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Include the JavaScript code within an HTML file, ensuring that the necessary HTML elements with corresponding `id` attributes are present.
2. Customize the code as needed, such as updating the validation messages or adding additional form fields.
3. Run the HTML file in a web browser to see the form validation in action.
